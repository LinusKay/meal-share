# meal-share
The last in a trilogy of terrible PHP websites.

Are you looking to hate food? Need to be put off eating for the rest of the day? Meal Share is the fastest growing repository of (randomly generated) recipes for the best food everyone knows and loves (MrSlime Cooking 2007). 

Connect with new friends to share your most beloved, or most despised recipes with the world. 

(Meal Share waives all responsibility for health issues as a result of the consumption of recipes hosted on this website)
